# Architecture Characteristics

This document outlines the key architectural characteristics of Clearview application. These characteristics guide our design and development decisions, ensuring that the system meets its functional and non-functional requirements.

### Considered Characteristics

- **Data Integrity and Correctness**: Ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout the system.
- **Workflow**: Defining clear and efficient processes for handling tasks and information flow within the application.
- **Extensibility and Adaptability**: Designing the system to accommodate future growth, new features, and changes in requirements.
- **Abstraction**: Creating modular and loosely coupled components to simplify development, maintenance, and future modifications.
- **Interoperability**: Enabling seamless integration with other systems and platforms, including third-party HR products.
- **Fault Tolerance and Availability**: Building a resilient system that can handle failures and maintain availability in case of disruptions.
- **Deployability**: Designing for easy and reliable deployment to various environments.


### Top 3 Key Characteristics

While all the above characteristics are important, we have prioritized the following as key drivers for our architecture:

#### Data Integrity and Correctness

##### Rationale:

**Sensitive Data**: Our application handles sensitive personal data, including resumes and candidate information. Maintaining the accuracy and integrity of this data is crucial for ethical and legal reasons.
**Reliable Insights**: The accuracy of our AI-powered features, such as resume screening and story generation, depends on the quality of the data.
**Trust and Transparency**: Both the job seekers and the potential employers need to trust that the information in the system is accurate and reliable.

##### Implementation:

**Data Validation**: Implement robust validation rules and constraints to ensure data accuracy at the point of entry and throughout the system.
**Data Quality Checks**: Perform regular data quality checks and cleansing to identify and address any inconsistencies or errors.
**Secure Data Storage**: Utilize secure data storage mechanisms to protect data from unauthorized access or modification.
**Auditing and Logging**: Maintain audit trails and logs to track data changes and ensure accountability.
**Favour immutability**: Favour immutability, thereby avoiding data mutation. This will help in auditing as well as driving insights on how various components, namely the LLM's are performing

#### Extensibility and Adaptability

##### Rationale:

**Evolving Needs**: The HR landscape is constantly evolving. Our application needs to be adaptable to accommodate new features, integrations, and changing business requirements.
**New Technologies**: We want to be able to leverage new technologies and advancements in AI/ML without requiring major system overhauls.
**Long-term Sustainability**: A flexible and adaptable architecture ensures the long-term viability and maintainability of the application.

##### Implementation:

**Modular Design**: Partition the system into loosely coupled modules with well-defined interfaces to facilitate independent development and evolution.
**Abstraction Layers**: Use abstraction layers to isolate specific functionalities and allow for easy replacement or upgrade of components.
**API-First Approach**: Design APIs that are stable and versioned to allow for independent evolution of different parts of the system.


#### Interoperability

#### Rationale:

**Integration with HR Systems**: Clearview needs to seamlessly integrate with existing HR products used by our customers.
**Data Exchange**: We need to be able to exchange data with other systems, such as background check providers or assessment platforms.


##### Implementation:

**Standardized APIs**: Utilize standardized APIs (e.g., REST) for communication with external systems.
**Integration Hub**: Implement an integration hub to manage connections with different third-party systems, handle data transformation, and ensure interoperability.
**Support for Multiple Data Formats**: Provide support for various data formats (e.g., JSON, XML) to facilitate data exchange with different systems.

By prioritizing these key characteristics, we aim to build a robust, adaptable, and interoperable application that meets the evolving needs of our users.
