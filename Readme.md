#### Details

Even though the UI is depicted in various services, these will be shown to the users (candidates and companies) as a unified portal. Each would be an MFE 



## TODO

   
1. Build sequence diagrams for these flows
2. Assumption is a single web based mechanism today for users. We may have an APP later (as we have everything behind API's)
3. Horizontal concerns are common - Observability, Security are common. Build them appropriately as libraries/services
