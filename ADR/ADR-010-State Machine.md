### Title: Implementing a State Machine for Resume Screening in Go

### Date: September 30, 2024

### Decision Maker: Clearview Engineering Team

### Status: Accepted

### Context:

The Clearview application needs to manage the lifecycle of a job as it progresses through various stages and based on various events and actions, it tranverses and moves states, and has certain statuses

### Decision:

We will implement a state machine in Go to manage the resume screening workflow.

### Rationale:
- 
- **Explicit State Management**: A state machine provides a clear and structured way to define and manage the different states a job posting can be in, ensuring that transitions between states are valid and consistent.
- **Improved Code Organization**: State machines promote better code organization by encapsulating state-related logic, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
- **Reduced Complexity**: State machines simplify complex decision-making logic by clearly defining the possible states and transitions, reducing the risk of errors and unexpected behavior.
- **Testability**: State machines are inherently testable, as each state and transition can be tested independently.
- Implementation:

We will utilize Go's features (structs, interfaces, functions) to implement the state machine.  The implementation will include:
- 
- **States**: Define an enum or constants to represent the possible states of a Job 
- **Events**: Define events that trigger transitions between states 
- **Transitions**: Implement functions or methods that define the logic for transitioning between states based on events.
- **State Machine**: A struct that holds the current state of a resume and provides methods for triggering events and transitioning between states.
