# ADR-002: Integration Hub for 3rd Party HR SaaS Products

### Date: 2024-09-30

### Status: Decided 

### Decision Maker: Engineerinig Team

### Context:

Our Clearview application needs to seamlessly integrate with a variety of third-party HR  products. These products use different API formats (e.g., REST, SOAP, GraphQL), authentication mechanisms, and data structures.  Directly integrating with each product individually would lead to:

- **High development and maintenance costs**: Each integration requires custom code and ongoing maintenance.
- **Increased complexity**: The application becomes tightly coupled with each third-party product, making it harder to understand and evolve.
- **Reduced scalability**: Adding new integrations becomes increasingly difficult and time-consuming.

This ADR proposes the creation of an Integration Hub to streamline and simplify integration with third-party HR  products. This approach will improve the maintainability, scalability, and flexibility of our application.

### Decision:

We will use an Integration Hub to handle communication with third-party HR products. The Integration Hub will:

- Provide a unified interface for interacting with external products.
- Abstract away the complexities of different API formats and data structures.
- Transform data to/from a common format used by our application.
- Provide logging, monitoring, and error handling capabilities.


### Consequences:

**Reduced development and maintenance costs**: The Integration Hub promotes code reuse and simplifies integration with new products.
**Improved scalability**: Adding new integrations becomes easier and faster.
**Increased flexibility**: The application becomes less dependent on specific third-party products.
**Potential performance overhead**: The Integration Hub may introduce some performance overhead due to data transformation and routing.


### Notes:
We will consider using an existing integration platform (e.g., Mulesoft, Dell Boomi) if it meets our requirements and budget or build a new one. 

#### Alternatives Considered:

- **Direct Integration**: Integrating with each product individually. This was rejected due to the high development and maintenance costs, increased complexity, and reduced scalability, and the challenges of different API formats and data structures.
