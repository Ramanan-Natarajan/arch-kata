# Using MFE in the Clearview App

### Date: September 30, 2024

### Decision Maker: Clearview Engineering Team


### Proposal

We will use Micro Frontends (MFEs) in the Clearview app. MFEs are independent web applications that communicate with each other through a shared API. This will allow us to develop and deploy each MFE independently, without having to worry about breaking other parts of the app.

### Benefits:

- **Increased agility**: MFEs allow us to develop and deploy features more quickly and independently.
- **Improved scalability**: MFEs can be scaled independently, which allows us to handle large amounts of traffic more efficiently.
- **Reduced complexity**: MFEs make the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
- **Improved user experience**: MFEs can be used to create a more engaging and personalized user experience.


### Risks
**Increased complexity**: MFEs can add complexity to the development and deployment process.
**Performance issues**: MFEs can introduce performance overhead if they are not implemented correctly.
**Integration challenges**: Integrating MFEs with each other and with the backend can be challenging.

### Decision:

We will use MFEs to modularize the Clearview app.
